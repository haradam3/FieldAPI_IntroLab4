# Field API Intro Lab 4 - Field API Web Intro Ex

This is a part of introductory materials for BIM 360 Field API.

The labs consist of four modules. Starting from Lab1, it incrementally 
adds code or reuse the code you have written, and implement toward a simple web service application.

This is the fourth one and is a "bonus" lab. It demonstrates a simple reporting feature by adding a chart showing the numbers of issue by status. No new Field API is used in this lab.  


**How to run the sample project**

* Make sure to have an account for BIM 360 Field. If you don't have it, you can get a trial account from here:

* No key and secret are needed to use Field API. 

The project is written in ASP.NET C#, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, .NET 4.5.2.

Dependency: RestSharp 106.2.0 (NuGet will automatically download a package when you build.) 

Disclaimer: Minimum error checking for simplicity and readability to focus on learning BIM 360 Field API.
